"""Inspect the top-down view in Orbit using pywinauto.

Before this script is run there needs to be a gamelet reserved and
"hello_ggp_standalone" has to be started.

The script requires absl and pywinauto. Since pywinauto requires the bitness of
the python installation to match the bitness of the program under test it needs
to by run from 64 bit python.

This automation script covers a basic workflow:
 - start Orbit
 - connect to a gamelet
 - select a process
 - take a capture
 - verify that the top-down view contains at least 3 rows
 - verify that the first item is "hello_* (all threads)"
 - verify that the second item is "hello_*]" or "Ggp*]"
 - verify that the children of the first item are "*clone" and "_start" (in any order)
