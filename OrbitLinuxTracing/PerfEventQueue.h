// This class implements a data structure that holds a large number of different
// perf_event_open records coming from multiple ring buffers, and allows reading
// them in order (oldest first).
// Instead of keeping a single priority queue with all the events to process,
// on which push/pop operations would be logarithmic in the number of events,
// we leverage the fact that events coming from the same perf_event_open ring
// buffer are already sorted. We then keep a priority queue of queues, where
// the events in each queue come from the same ring buffer. Whenever an event
// is removed from a queue, we need to move such queue down the priority
// queue. As std::priority_queue does not support decreasing the priority of
// an element, we achieve this by removing and re-inserting.
// In order to be able to add an event to a queue, we also need to maintain
// the association between a queue and its ring buffer. We use the file
// descriptor used to read from the ring buffer as identifier for a ring
// buffer. Keeping this association is what the pairs and the map are for.
// TODO: Implement a custom priority queue that supports decreasing the
//  priority.
