// This class implements a data structure that holds a large number of different perf_event_open
// records coming from multiple ring buffers, and allows reading them in order (oldest first).
//
// Instead of keeping a single priority queue with all the events to process, on which push/pop
// operations would be logarithmic in the number of events, we leverage the fact that events coming
// from the same perf_event_open ring buffer are already sorted. We then keep a priority queue of
// queues, where the events in each queue come from the same ring buffer. Whenever an event is
// removed from a queue, we need to move such queue down the priority queue.
//
// In order to be able to add an event to a queue, we also need to maintain the association between
// a queue and its ring buffer, which is what the map is for. We use the file descriptor used to
// read from the ring buffer as identifier for a ring buffer.
