  // Background and some terminology
  // When an elf file is loaded to memory it has its load segments
  // (segments of PT_LOAD type from program headers) mapped to some
  // location in memory. The location of the first segment is called a base
  // address.
  // Symbols addresses in the elf file however are not offsets from the base
  // address, they are calculated as offset from some virtual 0 where that
  // virtual zero can be different from the base address.
  //
  // The way to calculate the virtual zero is to take base address and substract
  // from it the minimum vaddr specified in PT_LOAD program headers.
  //
  // This method returns load bias for the elf-file if program headers are
  // available. This should be the case for all loadable elf-files.
