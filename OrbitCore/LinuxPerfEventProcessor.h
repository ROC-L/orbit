// This class implements a data structure that holds a large number of
//  possible DIFFERENT entries (events) of various perf ring buffers,
//  and allows reading them in a garantueed order (oldest first).
//  So it synchs the events from all the buffers according their timestamps.
// Its implementation builds on the following assumption:
//  We never expect events with a timestamp older than DELAY_IN_NS to be
//  added.
//  So we will stop processing at the first event that is close (according to
//  the delay) to the latest timestamp seen. If we only touch events that are
//  old enough, we will never process events out of order.

// TODO: instead of having unique pointers inside the priority_queue,
//  we could have a queue of LinuxPerfEvent objects. This would give use
//  better caching, but we need to copy more data, when rearanging the
//  heap on insertion.
// TODO: inserting to this buffer is log(num events). However, all events
//  within one ringbuffer are already sorted by the timestamp. So we could
//  implement a priority_queue of ringbuffers, to get log(num ringbuffers).
//  However, we would need to be very carefull, as the timestamps of the
//  buffers change over time, and there might be buffers, that do not have
//  a new event yet, but might have later.
