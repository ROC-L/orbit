// Let's unwind one frame using libunwindstack. With that unwinding step, the registers will get
// updated and we can detect if $rbp was modified.
// (1) If $rbp did not change: We are in a leaf function, which has not modified $rbp. The leaf's
//     caller is missing in the callchain and needs to be patched in. The updated $rip (pc) from
//     the unwinding step contains the leaf's caller.
// (2) If $rbp was modified, this can either be:
//     (a) We are in a non-leaf function and the callchain is already correct.
//     (b) We are in a leaf function that modified $rbp. The complete callchain is broken and should
//         be reported as unwinding error.
// As libunwindstack does not report us the canonical frame address (CFA) from an unwinding step, we
// cannot differentiate between (2a) and (2b) reliably. However, we do perform the following
// validity checks (for the reasoning remember that the stack grows downwards):
// (I)   If the CFA is computed using $rbp + 16, we know the $rbp was correct, i.e. case (2a)
// (II)  If $rbp is below $rsp, $rbp is not a frame pointer, i.e. case (2b)
// (III) If $rbp moves up the stack after unwinding, the sampled $rbp is not a frame pointer (2b)
//
// Note that we cannot simply set libunwindstack to unwind always two frames and compare the outer
// frame with the respective one in the callchain carried by the perf_event_open event, as in case
// of uprobes overriding the return addresses, both addresses would be identical even if the actual
// addresses (after uprobe patching) are not.
// More (internal) documentation on this in: go/stadia-orbit-leaf-frame-pointer
